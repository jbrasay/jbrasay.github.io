## About This Portfolio

This portfolio was built to enhance my understanding of the following technologies:

- **HTML**: For structuring content
- **CSS**: For styling and layout
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive design and ready-to-use components
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity and dynamic elements
- **jQuery**: For simplifying DOM manipulation and event handling

Additionally, I utilize the **Animate on Scroll (AOS)** library for scroll effects, **Animate CSS** for hover effects, and **Particles JS** library for the background effects.
